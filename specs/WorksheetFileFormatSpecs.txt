 PREFACE 

 Lotus Development Corporation's 1-2-3(TM) and Symphony(TM) perform user
 selected operations upon a data matrix that is termed a "worksheet". 

 Worksheet files are such matrices stored on disk. 

 A worksheet file is an unbroken sequence of binary coded records defining a
 single worksheet. 

 Both 1-2-3 and Symphony accept externally created data files if the files
 are in the worksheet file format.  Other programs can decode and process
 worksheet files created by 1-2-3 or Symphony. 

 The following document provides information required to create or access a
 worksheet file by describing the records used to create a worksheet file.
 It is assumed that the reader is familiar with Lotus products and has ready
 access to 1-2-3 or Symphony documentation. 

 Note that the worksheet files for 1-2-3 and Symphony are similar, but not
 necessarily interchangeable.  1-2-3 and Symphony share some record types,
 but also have record types unique to that product.  Symphony can read 1-2-3
 records, but 1-2-3 cannot read Symphony records.

 All efforts have been made to ensure that this information is clear and
 useful since Lotus will not be providing customer assistance with this
 booklet.  Lotus will, however, incorporate any necessary corrections if

 WORKSHEET FILE FORMAT 

 Worksheet files are organized as an unbroken sequence of variable length
 binary records.  Each record consists of a 4-byte header followed by the
 record body. The header defines the record's type and length, as the
 example below shows.
  
 The header's composition is as follows: 



 Byte Number               Byte Description 
 0,1                       Record type code 
 2,3                       Record body length (bytes) 


 Example: Record Header 

                               Record Header 

                           Record         Record 
                            Type          Length 

          Byte Number      0    1         2    3 
             Hex Code     1C   00        20   00 
   Decimal Equivalent       28             32 


 The record body can be of many different types; most have predetermined
 length, but some vary in length. 

 The record type code is 28. 

 In a hex dump of the file, the record type appears as 1C 00h, noting that
 the 8086/88 stores the most significant byte of word in the higher memory
 address. 

 The record length is 32 bytes. 
 In a hex dump of the file, the record length appears as 20 00h. 


 Record types with Column/Row Coordinates 

 Some record types contain column/row coordinates to identify a cell, or one
 of the two points that define a range.  Numbering starts at zero in the
 upper left corner of the worksheet. 
 For example: 

                             Cell A1 = column 0, row 0 





 SUMMARY OF RECORD TYPES 

 This section describes the different record types found in 1-2-3 and
 Symphony. 

 There are to Quick Reference tables ordered by Opcode and by Product,
 followed by a detailed reference section ordered by Opcode.  In the
 reference section, there are examples for the more commonly used records. 

 It is assumed that the reader is familiar with 1-2-3 or Symphony and has
 access to Lotus' documentation.

                  An implied leading 1 bit is at the beginning of the  
                  fraction.  The implied binary point is between the implied
                  1 bit and the Most  Significant Bit (MSB) of the fraction
                  field. 

 Special             NA:  S = 1 Exponent = 7FF Fraction = 0

 A Note on the Decompiler 

 The algorithm for the formula decompiler was taken verbatim from: 

 Writing Interactive Compilers and Interpreters, P.J. Brown, John Wiley 
 and Sons, 1979.  See chapter 6.2.  The algorithm itself is described on 
 pages 216 and 217. 

 This algorithm is also described in the following article: 

 More on the Re-creation of Source Code from Reserve Polish, P.J. Brown, 
 Software Practice and Experience, Vol 7, 545-551 (1977).

                      APPENDIX B:  The Formula Compiler 

 This appendix describes the internal workings of the formula compiler.  The
 compiler transforms an ASCII string of characters representing a formula to
 its Reverse Polish code.  The basic algorithm utilizes and SR parser (SR =
 shift and reduce).  The aim of the parser is to apply a set of reduction
 rules which embody the syntax of the compiler to an input string.  Formula
 code is compiled to a temporary buffer. 

 Lexicon Analysis 

 A lexical analyzer breaks up the input string into lexical units called
 tokens.  A token is a substring of the original input string operand,
 operator, or special symbol (such as comma, parentheses, etc.) In addition,
 the lexical analyser supplies two special tokens, "beginning of formula"
 (boform) and "end of formula" (eoform), to facilitate the compilation
 process.  The lexical analyzer identifies and processes literals (both
 number and string), cell and range references, operators, and function
 calls.  It assigns a unique code to each distinct operator, function, or
 type of operand. 

 A function with no arguments is treated like a number. 

 Syntax Analysis 

 The syntactical analysis of a formula is accomplished by processing a list
 of tokens in left-to-right order.  A stack called the syntax is also used
 during the syntactical scan.  The basic algorithm is as follows: 

 Repeat the following steps: 

 1) Get the next token 

 2) If the token is a literal or cell reference: 
       a) Push the number code on the syntax stack 
       b) Push the number code on the syntax stack 

 3) If the token is a range reference: 
       a) Compile code to push the range reference 
       b) Push the range code on the syntax stack 

 4) Otherwise push the token code for the token on the syntax stack. 

 For each syntax rule, if the pattern on the top of the  syntax matches the
 rule pattern take the action associated with the rule and start scanning
 from the beginning for any additional rules which may apply. 

 When a token code is pushed on the syntax stack, an additional word of
 zeros is also pushed on the stack.  This is used when compiling function
 calls to hold the function's argument count. 





 Rule Matching 

 A relatively small number of rules are used to process formulas of arbitrary
 complexity.  If a rule matches the top of the syntax stack, then the
 compiler takes a specific action and rule scanning starts again with the
 first rule.  Each rule matches certain patterns on the syntax stack.  A
 typical rule might be: if the top of the stack is the token for right
 parenthesis, and the next-to-top is a number, and the second form the top
 is a left parenthesis, then pop the top three items from the syntax stack
 and push the number on the syntax stack. 

 This rule can be more succinctly represented as: 

                        Stack 

          Before                      After                 Action 
          )

          (                           number                none 



 The Rules 


 The following are the syntax rules used to process formulas.  Note that the
 order of the rules is important.  The rules for compilation of operators
 used additional tables which assign a precedence number and opcode to each
 legal unary and binary operator.  Thus, for example, there is a single
 token code for minus sign (-), but there are two opcodes one for unary
 minus and one for binary minus.  In addition, these two operators, while
 lexically identical, also have different precedence.  In general, operators
 of higher precedence will be performed before operators of lower precedence
 are performed left-to-right.  All special operators (boform, eoform,
 parentheses, comma, etc.) are implicitly assigned a precedence of zero. 

 Rule 1  Termination test 

                  Stack 

         Before           After       Action

         number                       Return, indicating successful compile 
         boform

         number or range             function.

         number or range             function.

 Example: 

 Using the above rules, we can now see how a particular formula is
 compiled.  Let us consider the following formula: 

                  3+5*6 

 This is broken up by the lexical analyzer into seven tokens. 

                  boform 
                  3 
                  + 
                  5 
                  * 
                  6 
                  eoform 

 The syntax scans proceed as follows until a matching rule is found: 

 Stack 

 boform           number         +            number 
                  boform         number       + 
                                 boform       number 
                                              boform 

 Compile buffer 

                  push 3         push 3       push 3 
                                              push 5 

 At this point, rule 5 is invoked, but since the precedence of boform is
 zero, no action is taken. 

 Stack 

 *                number 
 number           * 
 +                number 
 number           + 
 boform           number 
                  boform 

 Compile buffer 

 push 3           push 3 
 push 5           push 5 
                  push 6 







 At this  point, since the binary precedence of + is lower than the binary
 precedence of *, rule 5 does apply, and the opcode for * is compiled.  The
 stack is reduced by replacing number * number by number and scan is made,
 but no further rule applies. 


 Stack 

 number          eoform 
 +               number 
 number          + 
 boform          number 
                 boform 

 Compile buffer 

 push 3          push 3 
 push 5          push 5 
 push 6          push 6 



 Rule 5 applies again, and the opcode for + is compiled, reducing the stack
 to boform, number, eoform.  Rescanning finds a match on rule 1 which
 compiles a return opcode and terminates.  The final compiled code is thus: 

 push 3 
 push 5 
 push 6 
 * 
 + 
 return 

 A Note on the Decompiler 

 The algorithm for the formula decompiler was taken verbatim from: 

 Writing Interactive Compilers and Interpreters, P.J. Brown, John Wiley and
 Sons, 1979.  See chapter 6.2.  The algorithm itself is described on pages
 216 and 217. 

 This algorithm is also described in the following article.

 Software Practice and Experience, Vol 7, 545-551 (1977). 










 WORKSHEET COLUMN DESIGNATORS 

 Most records within the 1-2-3 Condensed Worksheet format are specified
 with column/row designators (for example, column 0, row 0 equals A1).  When
 determining the column designator, the table below will help make
 conversion easier.
